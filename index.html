             <h1>Humble Beginnings</h1>
            <strong><small>I grew up in small town just outside of San Diego called El Centro. I was your typical first generation mexican kid who played all sorts of sports to stay out of troube, as well as learned to play a mulitude of instruments. I was always just looking for what was going to propel me out of the 'valley' as we called it. It was when I began playing football in highschool that I found genuine joy. This presented me with varies opporunities and making my parents proud seemed like a true possibility. Aspirations of still being involved with sports and a love of human anatomy lead me to pursue a degree in Kinisioloy at San Diego State University. The goal was to become an Occupation Therpaist was the inital goal but then I discovered a new opportunity.</small></strong>

            <h1>Passion for Football</h1>
            <strong><small>It was during my time at San Diego State University, that I began officiating football. I was drafted onto a crew my third year in the association to the officiating crew above. Our first year together we accomplished something special. Football officials even at the highschool level are being evlauted in order to who gets playoff assignments. Ultimately this leads to more exposure and the opportunity to get recruited to the next level. We consistantly graded well as a crew that we were the only crew that got to officiate together every round and even got a division 3 final assigned to us. After that gave I was invited to join the SCIAC to become a junior college official. I met my mentor at this point, a referree for the PAc-12 and he has guided me on a steady path to potentionally make it far. At this point my goal is to one day be in the NFL and felt that doing this bootcamp would allow me the opportunity to get a career that would allow me more flexibility to pursue my true dream. For anyone interested I have posted a link above for more information</small>

            <h1>Downtime Activities</h1>
            <strong><small>If it involves food I will always be ready to go. I don't just liek eating food, I also enjoy cooking. Does not matter what region of the world a particular cuisine will come from, if i find it tasty enough I will always try my hand and making a good imitation. Whether it is a new recipe or an old one always put effort into plating my food so that it looks delicious. I am a big believer in the phrase "you taste with your eyes first. Aside from cooking I love spending time with my dog, a germand shepard named Tatis. My girlfriend and I got him in the midst of the pandemic and in all honesty he brings so much joy to our lives that any activity we get to involve him is always a nice family moment. I never ask before petting dogs I meet in public, in case you were wondering.</small></strong>
